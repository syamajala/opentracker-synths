# opentracker-synths

Synth engine modules for [OpenTracker](https://github.com/sandlbn/polyend-tracker-re) 3.x, the open-source firmware
for the original Polyend Tracker. The engines are inspired by the Tracker Mini's synths but are
not identical to them.

| `modules/atype` | ATY1 | A-Type ("A-Type" on screen): duophonic two-oscillator synth: 2 VCOs (saw / pulse with PWM, hard sync), noise or ring modulator, sample & hold, HPF, 4-pole ladder or 2-pole SVF, ADSR and AR, LFO, glide; Keyboard Duo and Priority Last / Low / High at Poly 1 through the core's note priority (module engine 0x84, Patches/ATYPE/) |
| `modules/ttype` | TTY1 | T-Type ("T-Type" on screen): a drum synth in the classic analog drum machine style, one patch = one kit: kick, snare, clap, three toms, rim, cowbell, hats (closed .. open), crash / ride; a Character per drum, per-drum sends, Accent, Drive, Width; a cost governor (module engine 0x85, Patches/TTYPE/) |
| `modules/eight` | 8TY1 | 8-Type ("8-Type" on screen): a 3-voice 8-bit home computer style voice: three oscillators (tri, saw, pulse with PWM, 23-bit noise, the combined waves), ring and sync from the oscillator before, Filt / Clean routing, one 12 dB multimode filter per voice (Curve, 16 resonance steps, Dirt, Key Track, envelope), Grit, a 16-step ADSR, the CHIP tricks (module engine 0x86, Patches/8TYPE/) |
| `modules/hand` | HND1 | Hand-Type ("Hand-Type" on screen): a 4-channel handheld console style voice: one patch = one channel (Pulse with duty, sweep and a second pulse; Wave, 32 steps of 4 bits; Noise from a 15 / 7-bit register) or a drum kit by note; a 4-bit stepped envelope, Length, a small DAC, the CHIP tricks (module engine 0x87, Patches/HANDTYPE/) |
| `modules/btype` | BTY1 | B-Type ("B-Type" on screen): a 4-channel 8-bit home computer style voice with polynomial counters: divider-clocked channels (Tuning Free / Coarse / Fine), the buzz distortions, a second channel in divider steps, the high-pass pair trick, a 4-bit ADSR in 1/60 s frames, a small DAC, the CHIP tricks (module engine 0x88, Patches/BTYPE/) |
| `modules/arc` | ARC1 | Arc-Type ("Arc-Type" on screen): a home-console 4-operator FM style voice: eight algorithms, feedback, per operator MUL / DT / Level / Rate Scaling / a 5-rate envelope with loop modes / AMS, an LFO (PMS, AMS), a 9-bit DAC with a ladder character, an Aux square / noise voice, the CHIP arp and slide (module engine 0x89, Patches/ARCTYPE/) |
| `modules/dx7` | DX7S | DX7: six-operator FM, the 32 DX7 algorithms, DX7 `.syx` voice banks played as they were made (Patches/DX7/); OpenTracker fork card module, derived from msfa (module engine 0xF0) |

## How modules work

OpenTracker has no runtime plugin loading: the MK66 runs everything from flash. A **build
profile** in the core (`reimpl/profiles/<name>.toml`) lists the modules to compile in, and the
core's `tools/profile.py` reads each `module.toml`, checks it and generates the module registry.
Each module provides `ot::mod::IModule& <entry>()` (see the core's
`src/core/modules/module.h`, API major 1).

A module folder holds:

- `module.toml`: id, version, API major, entry function, sources, tests and declared budgets
  (flash, SRAM, SDRAM, fastrun bytes, CPU instructions per unit);
- `src/`: the engine and its `*_module.cpp` wrapper;
- `tests/`: host tests, built and run by the core's `make host-test`.

## Building

The core looks for this repo next to it (`MODULES_DIR`, default `../../opentracker-synths`
seen from `reimpl/`):

```
make -C ../ReversedPolytracker-3x/reimpl PROFILE=full MODULES_DIR=$PWD            # image
make -C ../ReversedPolytracker-3x/reimpl PROFILE=full MODULES_DIR=$PWD host-test  # tests
```

or `make image` / `make test` here (`CORE=<path to reimpl>`).

## Rules for module code

- No static constructors (namespace-scope objects must be constant-initialised), no heap.
- Voice state lives in the host's `SynthVoice::state`; per-voice render must stay within the
  declared `cpu_insn_per_unit` (checked by the core's `make perf-gate`).
- Only core headers: `modules/module.h`, `audio/synth_engine.h`, `audio/dsp.h`, `audio/va_dsp.h`,
  `audio/chip_dsp.h`, `audio/fm_dsp.h`, `fastrun.h` (the full list is in the core's `modules/module.h`).
